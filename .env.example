# LinkedNote Environment Variables Configuration

# SECRET_KEY: Used for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for user authentication.
# This should be a long, random string. Keep it secret and do not share it.
# Example: SECRET_KEY="super-secret-jwt-key-that-is-very-long-and-random"
SECRET_KEY="your-super-secret-key"

# ALGORITHM: The algorithm used for signing JWTs.
# Common choices are HS256, HS384, HS512. Must match the algorithm used in backend/core/security.py.
# Example: ALGORITHM="HS256"
ALGORITHM="HS256"

# OPENAI_API_KEY: Your API key for accessing OpenAI services (e.g., for text summarization).
# Obtain this from your OpenAI account dashboard.
# Example: OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# ENCRYPTION_KEY: Used for AES-256 encryption/decryption of sensitive data like API keys stored in the database.
# This should be a URL-safe base64-encoded 32-byte key.
# You can generate one using Python:
# python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
# Example: ENCRYPTION_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-encryption-key"
