		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Initial Scaffolding",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Setup Project Repository and Initial Scaffolding' into 3 subtasks. The subtasks should cover initializing the Git repository with a .gitignore file, creating the directory structure and initial files for the Python backend, and creating the directory structure for the front-end integration.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity. This task involves standard, well-documented setup procedures using common tools like Git and mkdir. It has no algorithmic or integration challenges and serves as a simple foundation for the project."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 28,
			"taskTitle": "Create Comprehensive End-to-End Test Suite",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Create Comprehensive End-to-End Test Suite' into 5 subtasks. The subtasks should cover setting up the E2E testing framework (e.g., Cypress, Playwright), creating a test for the core summarization flow, writing tests for various error conditions (e.g., invalid URL, API failure), developing tests for advanced and custom summarization modes, and integrating the test suite into a CI pipeline.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the need to integrate and automate interactions across multiple systems (frontend, backend, external APIs). Writing stable E2E tests that cover diverse user flows and error states is non-trivial and requires significant setup and maintenance effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Backend for Custom Profiles",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Backend for Custom Profiles' into 4 subtasks. These should include creating the database logic to fetch a profile by ID, developing a new API endpoint that accepts a profile ID, refactoring the core summarization service to use the fetched custom prompt instead of a hard-coded one, and implementing error handling for invalid or unauthorized profile IDs.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. It requires database interaction, modification of existing core business logic (the AI service), and new API endpoint logic. While it's a contained backend task, it touches and alters several important, interconnected pieces of the application."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Develop UI for API Key Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Develop UI for API Key Management' into 4 subtasks. The subtasks should cover designing the UI layout for the settings page, building the component to add a new key (with provider selection), creating the component to list, mask, and delete existing keys, and integrating these components with the backend API for full CRUD functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity as it involves standard frontend development for a full CRUD feature, including UI components, state management, and API integration. The requirement to handle sensitive data (masking keys) adds a layer of necessary care."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Notion Context Menu Trigger",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Develop Notion Context Menu Trigger' into 4 subtasks. The subtasks should focus on researching and configuring the Notion integration manifest to register the context menu item, developing the client-side code that listens for the menu trigger event, implementing the logic to extract the relevant data (like the clicked URL), and establishing the communication channel to pass this data to the backend service.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to the significant unknowns and potential constraints of integrating with a third-party UI (Notion). This is not standard web development and relies heavily on the specifics, capabilities, and limitations of the Notion platform API, which can be complex to work with."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Error Handling Notifications",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Basic Error Handling Notifications' into 3 subtasks. The subtasks should cover implementing or integrating a reusable UI notification/toast component, modifying the backend to return clear, structured error responses for common failures, and adding logic to the frontend's API client to catch these errors and trigger the UI notifications with user-friendly messages.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity. While it involves both frontend and backend work, the patterns for API error handling and displaying UI notifications are well-established. The main work is in plumbing the errors from the backend to the frontend component correctly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Web Content Fetching",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Basic Web Content Fetching' into 2 subtasks. The first subtask should be to write the function that takes a URL and uses an HTTP client library (e.g., requests) to fetch the page's raw HTML. The second subtask should be to add robust error handling for network failures, timeouts, and non-successful HTTP status codes (e.g., 404, 500).",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity. This is a self-contained backend function that uses standard libraries to perform a very common task. The scope is clearly defined and the implementation is straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 29,
			"taskTitle": "Prepare User Documentation and Onboarding",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Prepare User Documentation and Onboarding' into 4 subtasks. Create separate documentation sections for: 1) Initial setup and connecting the integration to a Notion workspace. 2) How to add, manage, and secure AI provider API keys. 3) A detailed guide on using built-in modes and creating custom summarization profiles. 4) A final review and editing pass for all content to ensure clarity and accuracy.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity. While not a coding task, creating clear, comprehensive documentation requires a thorough understanding of the entire application and is a crucial, time-consuming step. It is best broken down by feature area to ensure complete coverage."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Content Insertion into Notion",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Implement Content Insertion into Notion' into 4 subtasks. The subtasks should cover authenticating the Notion API client with the user's stored token, implementing logic to identify the correct parent block for insertion, formatting the summary text into the required Notion API block object format, and executing the `block.children.append` API call with proper error handling.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to the reliance on a specific third-party API (Notion). It requires learning the Notion API's authentication, data structures (blocks), and methods for content manipulation, which is more involved than a simple internal API call."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Single AI Model for Basic Summary",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand the task 'Integrate Single AI Model for Basic Summary' into 3 subtasks. The subtasks should be: 1) Set up the AI provider's SDK (e.g., OpenAI) and create a reusable client. 2) Write a service function that takes text content, formats it with a hard-coded summary prompt, and makes the API call. 3) Implement logic to parse the AI's response, extract the summary text, and handle potential API errors.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity. The task leverages a mature, well-documented SDK from a major provider. The primary work is in structuring the API call and parsing the response, not in complex algorithmic logic, as the prompt is fixed for this initial version."
